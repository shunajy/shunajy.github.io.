I hope you find it interesting.

Hi, I'm Shunashi, I'm 18 years old and I was born in Tabasco..


## About me

I am someone who enjoys simple things: a good sunset, a song that makes me feel calm and the small moments that become big memories. I consider myself dreamy, curious and cheerful.

## I like...

> like writing because I feel that words can hold emotions that sometimes cannot be spoken out loud.
